# Short bio shown in posts
bio: >-
  I use Bayesian inference and creative coding to explore black holes, gravitational waves, and playful visualisations.
---
I study black holes that smash into one another. More specifically, I use gravitational waves emitted from merging black holes to make inferences using Bayesian techniques. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Auckland, working with [Prof. Renate Meyer](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/renate-meyer). I am also a member of the [LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/), and the [OzGrav](https://www.ozgrav.org/) Centre of Excellence.
