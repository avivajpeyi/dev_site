For my PhD canditure I have to produce some reports documenting my progress:

* 6 months: [Initial Project Review Report](https://avi.vajpeyi.docs.ligo.org/initial_review/) 
* 12 months: [Confirmation Report](https://avi.vajpeyi.docs.ligo.org/confirmation_review/)

Note: to view these documents you may have to click on "Advanced > Proceed".
