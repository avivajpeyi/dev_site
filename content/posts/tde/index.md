When stars come too close to other stars, there will be exchanges of 
* angular momentum (J)
* energy

We will see how quickly J changes due to other stars
 
## Relaxation

* Weak encounter

$\frac{Gm}{b} << v^2$

$a\sim \frac{Gm}{b^2}$

$\Delta v\sim a\frac{b}{v}\sim\frac{Gm}{bv} << v$

Change in velocity is much smaller than the velocity of the star

If we have $N$ interactions with other stars,
$N\sim (v/\Delta v)^2 \sim (bv^2/Gm) \sim (b^2v^4/G^2m^2)$
Now we can get the interaction rate $\Gamma$ using the interaction cross section $\sigma$:

$\Gamma \sim n\sigma v \sim n\pi b^2v$

$\tau\sim N/ \Gamma \sim v^3/G^2m^2n$

$\tau$ is the two-body relaxation timescale.

Out of all the stars flying around, how often are stars within the semi-major axis of a pair of stars.


## TDE
Tidal disruption radius of star
$R_p < R_{TD} \sim r (m_{bh}/m_{star})^{1/3}$

$frac{GMr}{R^2 R} > \frac{Gm}{r^2}$

$\frac{v_p^2}{2}\sim \frac{GM}{R_p} \implies V_p = \sqrt(\frac{GM}{r})(\frac{m_{bh}}{m_{star}})^{1/3}


Assume parablolic orbit...
